## Disaster Mode ##
If you are in trouble and the mobile phone network breaks down, turn on the Twimight disaster mode (see screenshots) and keep tweeting even without Internet connectivity! This will turn on Bluetooth and your Tweets start spreading from phone to phone like an epidemic: Other Twimight users in Bluetooth range will automatically receive your Tweets and help you spread them to increase the chance to get heard. Once internet connectivity is back, your Tweets get published to the Twitter servers.

## Help Wanted ##
If you are interested in the project and would like to get involved, get in touch with us on Twitter @twimight.
